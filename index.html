            <h2>The Yoga</h2>

            <h3>Intro</h3>

            <p>Bikram Method Hatha Yoga is a sequence of 26 postures and 2 breathing exercises selected and developed by Bikram Choudhury, practiced in a heated room. It has been proved and experienced by millions that these 26 postures systematically work every part of the body, to give all the internal organs, all the veins, all the ligaments, and all the muscles everything they need to maintain optimum health and maximum function. Each component takes care of something different in the body, and yet they all work together synergistically, contributing to the success of every other one, and extending its benefits.</p>

            <p>Yoga changes the construction of the body from the inside out, from bones to skin and from fingertips to toes. So before you change it, you have to heat it up to soften it, because a warm body is a flexible body. Then you can reshape the body any way you want.</p>

            <p>Hatha Yoga flushes away the waste products, the toxins of all the glands and organs of your body. It provides a natural irrigation of the body through the circulatory system, with the help of the respiratory system. It brings nourishments to every cell of your body so that each one can perform its function and keep your body healthy. Bikram Yoga also employs heat to further that cleaning process: When you sweat, impurities are flushed out of the body through the skin. Practicing yoga not only increases our supplies of oxygen, but it also teaches us how to use that oxygen properly – we learn to control the breath through pranayama.</p>

            <h3>Bikram Choudhury’s story</h3>

            <p>Yogiraj Bikram Choudhury is the founder of the worldwide Yoga College of India™. Born in Calcutta in 1946, Bikram began Yoga at the age of four with India's most-renowned physical culturist at that time, Bishnu Ghosh, the younger brother of Paramahansa Yogananda (Author of the most popular book on Yoga, The Autobiography of a Yogi, and founder of the Self-Realization Fellowship in Los Angeles).</p>

            <p>Bikram practiced Yoga at least four to six hours every day at Ghosh's College of Physical Education in Calcutta. At the age of thirteen, he won the National India Yoga Championship. He was undefeated for the following three years and retired as the undisputed All-India National Yoga Champion.</p>

            <p>At seventeen, an injury to his knee during a weight-lifting accident brought the prediction from leading European doctors that he would never walk again. Not accepting their pronouncement, he had himself carried back to Bishnu Ghosh's school, for he knew that if anyone could help to heal his knee, it was his teacher. Six months later, his knee had totally recovered. Ghosh was a celebrated physical culturist and the first to scientifically document Yoga's ability to cure chronic physical ailments and heal the body.</p>

            <p>Bikram later on devised the 26 postures sequence, which work irrespective of age groups. These 26 postures series has a profound healing power on your body and mind. He founded Bikram’s Yoga College of India. Bikram has shown the light of healthy life to millions of people around the world.</p>

            <h3>Etiquette & FAQ</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Please respect your fellow yogis and this learning space by keeping minimal distraction to our group practice:
                        <ul>
                            <li>arrive class on time</li>
                            <li>maintain silence in the yoga room before, during and after class</li>
                            <li>stay in the yoga room for the whole duration of the class</li>
                            <li>practice stillness in between postures</li>
                            <li>avoid perfume or scented oils</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Try to avoid drinking water during the first three postures. This is to help you warm up your body and create internal heat. Drinking cold water slows down this process.</li>
                    <li>Sweating is your body's cooling mechanism so allow it happen. Wiping it off continually actually reduces your natural cooling.</li>
                    <li>Why is the room heated?</li>
                    <li>What are the benefits?</li>
                    <li>What if I am not flexible?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Perfect! You come to the right place :-) Yoga is not about how flexible you are. This is probably the most common misconception about yoga. Bikram Yoga combines strength, flexibility, balance, concentration and breath. As long as you are trying the postures the right way in your own “edge”, you are getting the benefits. With a consistent practice, your flexibility will improve as well as other aspects of the body and well-being.</li>
